# Steps For Installing Solaris 8 x86 on VirtualBox

I've spent many years working in the Sun architecture, from the
[SPARCstation 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARCstation_1)
through the [Sun Ultras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Ultra_series)
they were my first real taste of Unix and 32-bit computing.
Once in a while, I need to do something in this olde OS, and
using a virtual machine makes it easy.


This (hobby) project list the steps to build a Solaris 8 x86 in VirtualBox.
I see this topic come up and although there are many sites that document
how to do this, they are usually missing a kew key elements, or don't
go as far in the process as I'm attempting to do here.  Usually networking
is a challenge for these sites and after that, graphics beyond VGA 4-bit color,
and finally ssh.  Having said all of that, without those site, I would not
have taken this project as far as I've done, and I plagiarized many of the
steps and incorporated them here in this guide.  (I'll attribute the major ones
that have helped.)

There will probably be errors and omissions, but I hope these steps will be useful.
